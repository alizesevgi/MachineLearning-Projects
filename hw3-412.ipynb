To explain this further, below are attributes showing the scores given to the assigned participant by the main participant.\n",

        "To fix this, use one-hot-encoding to create one-hot features from the `goal` attribute. However, as `goal` attribute includes `NaN` values currently, we cannot directly use One-Hot-Encoding. We need to deal with the missing values first.\n",

        "  - Fill the missing values with value `6` *(denotes to `other`)*\n",
        "  - Create one-hot features from `goal` attribute,\n",
        "  - Name these features `goal_fun, goal_meet, goal_date, goal_serious, goal_did, goal_other` respectively,\n",
        "  - Add these features to the dataframe,\n",
